### Notes
The usage of the terminal and the installation of cocoapods was a very enlightening experience. It demonstrated the sheer amount of tools available to use developers to utilize to achieve multitudes of functionality in our ios projects. Most of my struggles in the development of this application revolved around the use of pods and AlamoFireImage, but after finally having successful installations of both products, I was able to enhance my appliciation with the images of the movies being listed.
