### Notes
In the second part of the Flix app, while the programming may have been easier as it was similar to the programming done in the first step, the layout and formatting of various elements in both the grid view and detail view was challenging. Formatting the grid view such that three movies would display seemlessly on each row was difficult, and took some assistance to get perfected. As for the detailed view, using multiple controllers and the bottom tab configuration was cool to see, demonstrating a really common fetaure that can be found on many major apps.

### Notes
The usage of the terminal and the installation of cocoapods was a very enlightening experience. It demonstrated the sheer amount of tools available to use developers to utilize to achieve multitudes of functionality in our ios projects. Most of my struggles in the development of this application revolved around the use of pods and AlamoFireImage, but after finally having successful installations of both products, I was able to enhance my appliciation with the images of the movies being listed.
